## The Fine Print

Please note that many users don't directly put their name as their username so it is hard to search people like them so try to ask them for their profiles and then it is all easy and can find out easily as the user search engine is very accurate about the names and can find anyone across all users. If you find something that seems off or unclear, we encourage you to double-check with other trusted sources. Your feedback is invaluable to us, especially as we're still in the beta phase.
